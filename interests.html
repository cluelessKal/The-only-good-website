<h1> Questions you might have for me </h1>

<p> What's your name?</p>
<p> My name is Kodi. </p>

<br>

<p> Are you gay? A communist? Jesus 2.0?</p>
<p>No, <b> God no</b>, obviously can't you tell? </p>

<br>
<br>

<p> Play any video games?</p>
<p> I usually get stuck playing one game for a long while until I get bored of it so I <br> haven't played that many games. Right now as I write this I've kind of lost interset in <br>  bloon tower defense 6 and I haven't really found another game to replace it<br> so I'm kind of in this video game limbo of not really playing anything.</p>

<br>
<p> How about sports?</p>
<p> I like to play tennis and watch some college football. <b>GO RAINBOW WARRIORS!!!!</b></p>

<br>
<br>

<p> Watch any T.V./Netflix?</p>
<p> Not a lot, if I'm watching anything it is either going to be twitch or youtube. <br>I just kind of wait for the football season and Rick and Morty to start.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p> Having a bad day?</p>
<p> Watch some motivational lizard to cheer your self up :) <?p>
